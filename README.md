# hello-world

I am a 38 year old mother of 2 teenage boys . I am happily married to my military veteran husband for 9 years. I do daycare from mynhome part time as well as i'm a tattoo artist and dabble in photography as a hobby. I was a nurse for many years and then became a morning show host on KKRD radio for a few years. That is my absolute passion is to be a radio dj. My hobbies besides photography  is running, traveling, singing, and fishing. I love trying new things and traveling as i have been all over the world due to military life. I now live in kansas and plan to stay for life.
